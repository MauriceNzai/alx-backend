## Learning Objectives
1. Learn how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages
2. Learn how to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings or request headers
3. Learn how to localize timestamps

## Tasks

### 0. Basic Flask app
First you will setup a basic Flask app in 0-app.py. Create a single / route
and an index.html template that simply outputs “Welcome to Holberton” as
page title (<title>) and “Hello world” as header (<h1>).

### 1. Basic Babel setup
Install the Babel Flask extension:
	$ pip3 install flask_babel==2.0.0
Then instantiate the Babel object in your app. Store it in a module-level
variable named babel.
In order to configure available languages in our app, you will create a Config
class that has a LANGUAGES class attribute equal to ["en", "fr"].
Use Config to set Babel’s default locale ("en") and timezone ("UTC").
Use that class as config for your Flask app.
